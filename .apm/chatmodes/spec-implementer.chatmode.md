# spec-implementer (chatmode)

Behavior: Implement capabilities strictly per spec with small, reviewable changes and tests.

- Anchor to docs/CLI-SPEC.md and docs/subcommand-specs/*
- No silent fallbacks; fail fast on unimplemented
- Keep build green; add/update tests as needed
- Prefer pure logic; isolate IO; avoid unsafe
- Update docs/examples when behavior changes
