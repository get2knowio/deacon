**Summary**
- The workspace is cleanly split into `crates/deacon` (CLI) and `crates/core` (shared logic) with clear module boundaries and feature flags. The code adheres well to idiomatic Rust patterns (no unsafe, structured error taxonomy, `tracing`-based logging, clap for CLI parsing, async boundaries handled with Tokio) and aligns with the repository guidelines.
- Core functionality substantially reproduces the Dev Containers CLI behavior: config discovery and parsing (JSONC), variable substitution, merge semantics, Docker vs. Compose flows, lifecycle execution, ports handling with PORT_EVENT output, progress events/metrics/audit logging, host requirement checks, templates and features (metadata, packaging; partial publish), doctor output, and state/shutdown management.
- Gaps remain relative to the TypeScript CLI and the spec: several sub‑areas are intentionally stubbed or partially implemented (e.g., features publish to registry, templates apply, run‑user‑commands, storage evaluation for host requirements, richer CLI flag surface and compatibility messages). These are good next targets.

**Rust Quality Review**
- Structure and modules
  - Good crate split: CLI glue in `deacon`, heavy lifting in `deacon-core`. Modules are cohesive (`config`, `docker`, `compose`, `lifecycle`, `ports`, `progress`, `security`, `host_requirements`, `features`, `templates`, `state`).
  - Feature flags used appropriately: `core` defaults to `docker`; optional `json-logs`, `plugins`. `deacon`’s `docker` feature gates Docker interactions and returns clear NotImplemented errors when disabled.
- Errors and results
  - Rich, domain-specific error types in `crates/core/src/errors.rs` with `thiserror`; binary uses `anyhow::Result` at boundaries as advised. Diagnostic messages are specific and tested.
  - Special NotImplemented handling in `main.rs` with exit code 2 matches legacy expectations for certain flows.
- Logging and progress
  - Logging via `tracing` with env filtering; respects `RUST_LOG`. `json-logs` feature is plumbed.
  - Progress events (`build.*`, `container.create.*`, `lifecycle.phase.*`) and audit log with rotation; metrics histogram with summaries. JSON progress file routing is supported through `cli.rs`.
- CLI parsing and UX
  - Clap v4 with clear subcommands and flags. Global flags: `--log-format`, `--log-level`, `--progress`, `--progress-file`, `--workspace-folder`, `--config`, `--override-config`, `--secrets-file`, `--no-redact`.
  - Subcommands implemented: `up`, `build`, `exec`, `read-configuration`, `features`, `templates`, `down`, `doctor`. `run-user-commands` exists but returns NotImplemented.
- Concurrency and I/O
  - Docker/Compose interactions are done via `std::process::Command`, properly passing args without shell expansion. Long‑running/synchronous CLI calls moved into `spawn_blocking` where appropriate.
  - No unsafe code; clean use of `tokio` and careful cross‑thread sharing (Arc<Mutex<Option<ProgressTracker>>>) where needed.
- Testing
  - Extensive unit and integration tests across core modules and CLI, hermetic with fixtures; no network assumptions in tests. Follows guideline locations and patterns.

**Parity With devcontainers/cli (TypeScript)**
- Commands and general behavior
  - `up`: Supports traditional container and Compose; remove/reuse behavior; lifecycle phases (`onCreate`, `postCreate`, `postStart`, `postAttach`); port events (`PORT_EVENT: {json}`) and optional shutdown. Mirrors the flow described in docs/subcommand-specs/*/SPEC.md and TS CLI.
  - `build`: Config discovery, host requirement validation, build config extraction (`dockerFile`, `build.context/target/options`), deterministic config hash, cache layer, Docker build args ordering, progress begin/end, and result output (text/JSON). Disallows direct build for Compose projects as TS CLI does.
  - `exec`: Resolves container by identity labels, runs command with TTY detection, supports `--user`, `--no-tty`, `--env`, and working directory derivation per spec (`containerWorkspaceFolder` or `/workspaces/{name}`).
  - `read-configuration`: Discovery, overrides, secrets, substitution, and merged output. Matches TS behavior of merging override and applying variables before output.
  - `features` and `templates`: Metadata parsing and packaging are present; publish is simulated or dry‑run only; `info` and `apply` not implemented. This diverges from full TS CLI coverage.
  - `down`: Uses saved state (container or compose) and honors configured shutdown action (`stopContainer`, `removeContainer`, `stopCompose`, `none`), and supports auto-discovery fallback. Consistent with TS CLI intent.
  - `doctor`: Present with context; collects relevant environment information.
- Configuration and spec mapping
  - JSONC parsing via `json5`, unknown keys logged, schema mapped to strong types for key fields; supports `extends` resolution and merge rules in `ConfigMerger` consistent with spec (last‑writer‑wins for maps, lifecycle arrays override, feature maps merge, `runArgs` append, etc.).
  - Variable substitution via `SubstitutionContext` including workspace/env/secrets; applied across paths, env, lifecycle commands.
  - Docker Compose handling leverages `docker compose` CLI: file resolution, project naming, `ps` parsing, run services, and security option warnings that must be specified in compose files. This follows spec guidance.
  - Ports: `forwardPorts`, `appPort`, `portsAttributes`, `otherPortsAttributes` modeled; events emitted with required prefix; behavior matches reference CLI behavior.
  - Host requirements: CPU/memory parsing matches spec units; evaluation scaffolded with `sysinfo`. Storage evaluation is currently a placeholder with warnings.

**Notable Gaps vs. TS CLI and Spec**
- Features/templates publishing
  - Features `publish` returns unimplemented unless `--dry-run`; templates `publish` simulates a push. Full OCI registry integration (auth, push, list) is not implemented yet.
  - `features info` and `templates apply` are not implemented.
- Run user commands
  - `run-user-commands` subcommand is present but returns NotImplemented.
- Host requirements
  - Storage check is stubbed (always “large value”) with a warning; spec calls for actual disk availability checks. CPU/memory are implemented.
- CLI flag parity
  - Many essential flags are present, but some TS CLI flags/aliases/compat messages may be missing (e.g., additional id/label controls, explicit `--id-label`, richer progress/redaction controls, user‑data folders, and specific `--output` conventions). A systematic crosswalk with devcontainers/cli help output would ensure full parity.
- Docker/OCI surface area
  - Only Docker CLI is supported (feature‑gated); no Podman compatibility layer. Some advanced build options (buildkit config, secrets, SSH forwarding, cache mounts) are not exposed.
- Lifecycle nuances
  - Non‑blocking behavior flags are plumbed but lifecycle executor treatment for `postStart`/`postAttach` semantics is simplified. Compare with TS CLI’s nuanced behavior for non‑blocking phases and log streaming.
- Security
  - Redaction uses a naive substring and a non‑cryptographic hash placeholder; consider a robust SHA‑256 and structured key/value redaction integrated with output sinks. Some surfaces (audit, progress, PORT_EVENT) do not explicitly apply redaction before printing.

**Spec Adherence (containers.dev)**
- Strong areas
  - Config discovery (`devcontainer.json`, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`), JSONC parsing; core schema mapped for key fields; merge semantics implemented and tested; variable substitution applied widely.
  - Compose vs. container split correctly modeled; security options flagged for compose; lifecycle hooks wired; ports attributes honored; feature install order override support present.
  - Progress and audit logging add observability consistent with spec intent for machine‑readable outputs.
- Deviations/omissions
  - Some configuration fields are left as raw JSON, which is fine for early iterations but limits validation. Expand strong typing gradually (e.g., `customizations`, `features` details, mounts).
  - OCI registry interactions (feature/template fetch/push) are incomplete; spec requires robust OCI handling, including auth flows.
  - Doctor/support bundle details may need to be fleshed out to match the spec’s expectations for diagnostics.

**Testing & Quality**
- Pros
  - Wide unit test coverage across modules; integration tests for CLI behaviors and state flows; use of fixtures for templates/features/configs; hermetic tests with good assertions.
  - Clear code comments, docstrings with examples, and debug logging help traceability.
- Improvements
  - Add golden tests for progress event sequences and port event JSON to pin protocol stability.
  - Add tests for `--prefer-cli-features`, feature install order merging, and conflict resolution.
  - Add tests validating NotImplemented exit code behavior across commands.

**Recommendations**
- Parity and UX
  - Do a flag‑by‑flag parity pass against devcontainers/cli `--help` for each subcommand; add missing aliases/flags and compatibility warnings. Document any intentional deviations in README.
  - Align default outputs and exit codes with TS CLI where tests expect legacy strings (already done in some places, e.g., “No devcontainer.json …”).
- Host requirements
  - Implement real storage availability checks for the active workspace path; include platform‑aware logic and tests. Consider reporting and thresholds similar to TS CLI.
- OCI registry and publishing
  - Implement end‑to‑end `features publish`/`templates publish` with OCI push, including auth, tags, and digests. Add `features info` and `templates apply` to match TS CLI.
  - Consider a small abstraction in `core::oci` for registry interactions and caching with retries and backoff.
- Security and redaction
  - Use cryptographic hashing (e.g., `sha2`) for secret tracking; systematically apply redaction to all user‑visible outputs (progress, doctor, audit, PORT_EVENT). Respect `--no-redact` consistently.
- Lifecycle and compose
  - Flesh out non‑blocking lifecycle phase semantics and log streaming; add timeouts and better error aggregation akin to TS CLI.
  - Compose: add `run_services` orchestration parity and improve container ID resolution across multiple services for `exec` and port events.
- Docker/OCI options
  - Expose advanced build options surfaced by TS CLI (buildkit toggles, `--build-arg` types, secrets/ssh, cache‑from/to) and broaden runtime support (Podman if desired).
- Documentation
  - Expand docs with a parity matrix vs. TS CLI, and an implementor checklist matched to containers.dev. Link examples in EXAMPLES.md to spec sections.

**Overall Assessment**
- Strong, idiomatic Rust implementation that cleanly maps to the Dev Containers spec with thoughtful separation of concerns and a robust testing approach. It already covers the majority of workflows (up/build/exec/down/config/ports/progress) and establishes solid foundations (config/merger, lifecycle, compose, docker abstraction).
- The remaining work is largely about completeness and parity: OCI publishing, a few commands, richer host checks, and feature/flag surface area. These are well‑scoped next steps and fit naturally into the existing module design.
