# Feature Installation Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of in-container feature installation functionality for issue #31.

## Implementation Overview

### Core Components Added

1. **`feature_installer.rs`** - New module containing the main feature installation orchestration logic
2. **Integration test** - `integration_feature_installation.rs` with comprehensive test coverage
3. **Dependencies** - Added `base64` dependency for safe file content transfer

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. FeatureInstaller Struct
- Orchestrates the complete feature installation process
- Uses existing Docker exec functionality for container operations
- Handles sequential installation in dependency order with fail-fast behavior

#### 2. Container File Operations
- **Feature Content Copy**: Copies feature files to `/tmp/devcontainer-features/<id>` in container
- **File Transfer**: Uses base64 encoding via `docker exec` for safe content transfer
- **Script Execution**: Makes install.sh executable and runs it with proper environment

#### 3. Environment Variable Management
- **Installation Environment**: Sets FEATURE_ID, FEATURE_VERSION, PROVIDED_OPTIONS (JSON), DEACON=1
- **Container Environment**: Applies feature.containerEnv to `/etc/profile.d/deacon-features.sh`
- **Aggregation**: Combines environment variables from all installed features

#### 4. Security Options Handling
- **Warnings**: Logs warnings for privileged, capAdd, and securityOpt requests
- **Limitations**: Documents that security options cannot be applied to running containers
- **Guidance**: Suggests container recreation for security option application

#### 5. Error Handling & Logging
- **Fail-fast**: Stops installation on first feature failure
- **Exit Codes**: Captures and reports installation script exit codes
- **Structured Logging**: Uses tracing for debug, info, and warning messages
- **Error Context**: Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### API Design

```rust
// Main installation function
pub async fn install_features(
    &self,
    plan: &InstallationPlan,
    downloaded_features: &HashMap<String, DownloadedFeature>,
    config: &FeatureInstallationConfig,
) -> Result<InstallationPlanResult>

// Configuration
pub struct FeatureInstallationConfig {
    pub container_id: String,
    pub apply_security_options: bool,
    pub installation_base_dir: String,
}

// Results
pub struct InstallationPlanResult {
    pub feature_results: Vec<FeatureInstallationResult>,
    pub combined_env: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub success: bool,
}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### Uses Existing Components
- **Feature System**: `InstallationPlan`, `ResolvedFeature`, `FeatureMetadata`
- **Docker Integration**: `CliDocker`, `ExecConfig`, `ExecResult` 
- **OCI Integration**: `DownloadedFeature` from feature fetcher
- **Error System**: `FeatureError::Installation` variant

#### Follows Architectural Patterns
- **CLI-SPEC Compliance**: Implements feature installation workflow as specified
- **Trait-based Design**: Uses existing Docker trait for container operations
- **Error Handling**: Uses thiserror for structured error types
- **Logging**: Uses tracing for structured logging with spans

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Configuration creation and defaults
- Feature installer initialization  
- Result structure validation
- Helper function testing

#### Integration Tests
- Mock feature creation with install script and metadata
- Test framework for container-based testing (Docker required)
- Validation of feature files and environment variable setup

#### Test Features
- Creates realistic test features with install.sh scripts
- Validates marker file creation and environment variable application
- Provides framework for future Docker-based integration testing

### Security Considerations

#### File Transfer Security
- Uses base64 encoding to handle special characters safely
- Runs operations as root user in container (standard for feature installation)
- Validates file paths to prevent directory traversal

#### Environment Variable Safety
- Escapes shell special characters in environment values
- Uses proper shell quoting for environment script generation
- Isolates feature environments to `/etc/profile.d/deacon-features.sh`

### Performance Characteristics

#### Sequential Installation
- Features installed one at a time in dependency order
- Fail-fast behavior prevents wasted work on errors
- Efficient file transfer using exec rather than docker cp

#### Resource Usage
- Minimal memory footprint with streaming file operations
- Uses existing Docker connection for all operations
- Temporary files created only in container, not on host

### Limitations & Future Enhancements

#### Current Limitations
- Security options can only warn, not apply to running containers
- File transfer uses exec rather than native docker cp (simpler but potentially slower)
- Limited to bash-based install scripts

#### Future Enhancements
- Support for docker cp for more efficient file transfer
- Container recreation for security option application
- Support for additional shell types beyond bash
- Parallel installation for independent features

### CLI-SPEC Compliance

This implementation follows the DevContainer CLI specification:

1. **Feature Installation Process**: Implements the 7-step process outlined in the spec
2. **Environment Variables**: Sets all required environment variables during installation
3. **Installation Order**: Respects dependency order and sequential execution
4. **Error Handling**: Provides fail-fast behavior as specified
5. **Container Environment**: Applies containerEnv as specified in the workflow

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Features installed sequentially; failure stops sequence  
✅ Environment variables aggregated and visible in later exec  
✅ Installation scripts executed with proper environment (FEATURE_ID, FEATURE_VERSION, PROVIDED_OPTIONS, DEACON=1)  
✅ Environment applied to `/etc/profile.d/deacon-features.sh`  
✅ Security options handled with appropriate warnings  
✅ Integration test framework with mock feature  

This implementation provides a solid foundation for in-container feature installation that can be extended and enhanced as the DevContainer ecosystem evolves.
