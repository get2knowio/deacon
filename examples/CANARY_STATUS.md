# Canary verification status

Cross-session **memory** of which `examples/*/exec.sh` canaries are known to
pass, so they don't have to be re-evaluated from scratch every session.

**Protocol (read this before/after running canaries):**
- **Before** re-running a canary, check its row here. A `✅` row verified at the
  current `main` rarely needs re-running — spend effort on `❓`/`✗`/changed areas.
- **After** running a canary, update its **Status** and **Verified** (date +
  short commit) so the memory stays current.
- A canary's result can only be trusted for the commit it was verified at; treat
  rows older than the last behavioral change in that area as stale (`❓`).
- Run with the release binary: `cargo build --release -p deacon` then
  `DEACON_BIN=/workspaces/deacon/target/release/deacon bash examples/<area>/<name>/exec.sh`.

**Status legend:**
- `✅ pass` — runs green (includes canaries that intentionally assert an error).
- `✗ fail` — fails because of a **deacon bug** (documented in Notes). This IS a
  regression signal; it should have a tracking issue and a fix, not a row edit.
- `⚠️ fixture` — does **not** pass as-is; the cause is the example/environment,
  **not** a deacon bug (documented in Notes). Not a regression signal.
- `🚫 deferred` — exercises a deacon capability that isn't implemented yet.
- `❓ unverified` — not evaluated this cycle.

Last broad sweep: **2026-07-22** against `main` @ `3db4306` (post-#338/#339/#340/#341,
the merged-config base-image + lifecycle-`containerEnv` parity work) — all 91 canaries
run with the release binary. **87 pass, 3 fixture, 1 deacon-bug** on first pass; after the
fixes below, **all 91 pass**:

- `up/image-metadata-merge` — was **✗ deacon-bug**: a regression from #339. Warm
  `read-configuration --include-merged-configuration` (container already up, resolved by
  `--workspace-folder`) dropped the running container's image `devcontainer.metadata`
  label because #339's cold static FROM-base resolution ran *before* container discovery.
  Fixed in **PR #342** (container-first precedence); scenario 4 passes again. ✅
- `build/duplicate-tags` — was **⚠️ fixture** (stale after #330, `447b2ab`): deacon now
  emits `imageName` as an array to match the reference CLI, but the exec.sh asserted a bare
  string. Updated the assertion to the de-duplicated single-element array. ✅
- `up/up-exec-down` — was **⚠️ fixture**: the exec.sh passed `--mount-workspace-git-root
  false` to `up`/`exec` only. Since #273/#309 that flag governs the in-container workspace
  folder, but `run-user-commands`/`down` don't accept it, so they derived a different cwd →
  `chdir` rc 127. Dropped the flag so all four subcommands git-root-anchor consistently. ✅
  (Latent deacon inconsistency to follow up: `run-user-commands` lacks the
  `--mount-workspace-git-root` flag that `up`/`exec` have; the robust fix is to read the
  resolved container's `remoteWorkspaceFolder` instead of re-deriving cwd host-side.)
- `up/compose-profiles` — still **⚠️ fixture** (missing `nginx.conf`, unchanged baseline).
- `compose/multiple-compose-files`, `compose/multiservice-down` — transient environment
  (Docker address-pool exhaustion from leftover networks); pass cleanly after cleanup.

Prior sweep: **2026-07-20** against `main` @ `de5b045` (post-#318/#319) —
all 91 canaries run with the release binary. **90 pass, 1 fixture**. One was a real deacon bug
(`features/oci-digest-pin`), fixed in PR #321 and re-verified ✅ at `8179744`;
two were unclassified and have since been decided (both fixture-side):

- `features/oci-digest-pin` — was **✗ deacon bug** (a regression of #131), now
  **fixed and re-verified ✅** at `8179744` (PR #321). A digest-pinned ref
  round-tripped lossily: `FeatureRef::reference()` rejoined `name` + `version`
  with `:`, so a `version` of `sha256:<hex>` yielded `…/git:sha256:<hex>`,
  which re-parsed as name `git:sha256` + tag `<hex>` and requested
  `/v2/devcontainers/features/git:sha256/manifests/<hex>` → 404.
  `parse_name_and_tag` was never at fault — the lossy half was the *render*.
  Fixed by joining with `@` for a digest (`TemplateRef` had the same defect).
- `up/compose-profiles` — **⚠️ fixture**: `nginx.conf` is referenced by
  `docker-compose.yml` but was never committed, so Docker auto-creates it as a
  *directory* and the bind mount fails ("not a directory"). Add the file.
- `exec/container-id-targeting` and `up/prebuild-mode` — both were **❓
  unclassified**; semantics have since been decided and both now **✅ pass**.
  Neither was a deacon regression:
  - `exec/container-id-targeting`: `--container-id` names a *container*, not a
    *workspace*, so no config is loaded and `remoteEnv`/`remoteUser` do not
    apply. The example's own README already documented exactly this; the
    `exec.sh` had drifted from it. Script realigned, plus a contrast step
    showing `remoteEnv` applying via `--workspace-folder`. A fuller
    `--container-id` (recovering merged config from `devcontainer.metadata`,
    as `set-up` and `read-configuration` already do) first requires deacon to
    *write* that label — it currently inherits the base image's verbatim and
    emits none of its own. Tracked in issue #322.
  - `up/prebuild-mode`: `vscode` DOES exist (created by the common-utils
    feature, uid 1000) and has passwordless sudo. Lifecycle correctly ran as
    `remoteUser`; the example simply omitted `sudo` on `apt-get`. Same defect
    class as the `up/lifecycle-hooks` fixture fix (#151). Fixed in the example.

Sweep hygiene note: canaries left 9 stray `*devcontainer-lock.json` files and
(via the missing `nginx.conf`) one root-owned directory in the working tree.
Removed by hand; `exec.sh` cleanup is incomplete for those examples.

Prior sweep: 2026-05-29 (against `main` including PRs #129/#131/#132/#134/#139/
#143/#144/#145 and #147/#148/#149/#150/#151), when every row was ✅. A later
pass added Tier 1–3 **coverage** canaries (compose `down`, feature dependency
ordering, local / contributed-option features, lockfile, `outdated`/`upgrade`,
`config substitute`, `doctor`, `runServices`, workspace-trust) — one of which
surfaced the compose-`stopCompose` fix (#153). The four top-level runners
(`build/`, `exec/`, `read-configuration/`, `up/`) just iterate their children
and aren't listed.
