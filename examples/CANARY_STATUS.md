# Canary verification status

Cross-session **memory** of which `examples/*/exec.sh` canaries are known to
pass, so they don't have to be re-evaluated from scratch every session.

**Protocol (read this before/after running canaries):**
- **Before** re-running a canary, check its row here. A `✅` row verified at the
  current `main` rarely needs re-running — spend effort on `❓`/`✗`/changed areas.
- **After** running a canary, update its **Status** and **Verified** (date +
  short commit) so the memory stays current.
- A canary's result can only be trusted for the commit it was verified at; treat
  rows older than the last behavioral change in that area as stale (`❓`).
- Run with the release binary: `cargo build --release -p deacon` then
  `DEACON_BIN=/workspaces/deacon/target/release/deacon bash examples/<area>/<name>/exec.sh`.

**Status legend:**
- `✅ pass` — runs green (includes canaries that intentionally assert an error).
- `⚠️ fixture` — does **not** pass as-is; the cause is the example/environment,
  **not** a deacon bug (documented in Notes). Not a regression signal.
- `🚫 deferred` — exercises a deacon capability that isn't implemented yet.
- `❓ unverified` — not evaluated this cycle.

Last broad sweep: **2026-05-29** (against `main` including PRs #129/#131/#132/
#134/#139/#143/#144/#145 and this session's #147/#148/#149/#150/#151). Every
row is currently ✅ — the last `❓`/`⚠️` rows (`down/basic`, the `exec/*` and
`up/*` fixtures) were unblocked by those five PRs. A later pass added Tier 1–3
**coverage** canaries (compose `down`, feature dependency ordering, local /
contributed-option features, lockfile, `outdated`/`upgrade`, `config
substitute`, `doctor`, `runServices`, workspace-trust) — one of which surfaced
the compose-`stopCompose` fix (#153). The four top-level runners (`build/`,
`exec/`, `read-configuration/`, `up/`) just iterate their children and aren't
listed.
