# Tasks: Features Info GAP Closure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-close-features-info-gap/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Included per research.md (unit + CLI smoke). Tests are organized under each story.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- [P]: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story]: US1, US2, US3, US4 (from spec.md)
- Each task includes an exact file path

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Lightweight documentation scaffolding to support acceptance tracking.

- [ ] T001 [P] Create acceptance checklist doc in specs/004-close-features-info-gap/checklists/features-info.md

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core utilities, data contracts, and CLI flag surface required by all stories.

- [ ] T002 [P] Create text module stub in crates/core/src/text/mod.rs
- [ ] T003 [P] Implement boxed text utility (Unicode headers) in crates/core/src/text/boxing.rs
- [ ] T004 Expose text module from core lib (add `pub mod text;`) in crates/core/src/lib.rs
- [ ] T005 Add `get_manifest_with_digest` (returns manifest + sha256 digest of body) in crates/core/src/oci.rs
- [ ] T006 Implement tag pagination with Link headers and page/total cap (10 pages/1000 tags) in crates/core/src/oci.rs
- [ ] T007 [P] Define Features Info data contracts (VerboseJson, PublishedTags, etc.) in crates/core/src/features_info.rs
- [ ] T008 [P] Replace `--json` with `--output-format <text|json>` for `features info` in crates/deacon/src/cli.rs
- [ ] T009 [P] Add unit tests for data contracts and helper serialization in crates/core/tests/features_info_models.rs

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready â€” user story phases can now proceed independently (US1/US2 in parallel; US3 independent; US4 depends on US1â€“US3).

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 â€” Inspect manifest and canonical ID (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Fetch OCI manifest and compute/emit canonicalId; support local refs with `canonicalId: null`.

**Independent Test**: Run `deacon features info manifest <ref>` and validate text (boxed sections) and JSON output contract.

### Tests (write first)
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Unit test: canonicalId computation from manifest bytes digest in crates/core/tests/canonical_id.rs
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] CLI smoke tests: text + JSON outputs and error `{}` cases in crates/deacon/tests/integration_features_info_manifest.rs

### Implementation
- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement `manifest` mode using `default_fetcher_with_config(10s)` in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs
- [ ] T013 [US1] Enforce JSON contract: stable keys; `{}` + exit 1 on errors; `canonicalId: null` for local refs in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs
- [ ] T014 [US1] Canonical ID helper wiring to `get_manifest_with_digest` in crates/core/src/oci.rs
- [ ] T015 [US1] Use core text boxing to print "Manifest" and "Canonical Identifier" sections in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs

**Checkpoint**: US1 independently demonstrable (text + JSON).

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 â€” Discover published tags (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: List published tags with pagination, 10s timeout, and stable sorting.

**Independent Test**: Run `deacon features info tags <ref>` and validate text (boxed list) and JSON output `{ "publishedTags": [...] }`.

### Tests (write first)
- [ ] T016 [P] [US2] Unit test: pagination parsing and caps (10 pages/1000 tags) in crates/core/tests/integration_oci_enhancements.rs
- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] CLI smoke tests: text + JSON outputs and `{}` + exit 1 on error in crates/deacon/tests/integration_features_info_tags.rs

### Implementation
- [ ] T018 [US2] Implement `tags` mode using paginated `list_tags` (sorted deterministically) in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs

**Checkpoint**: US2 independently demonstrable.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 â€” Visualize dependency graph (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Render Mermaid dependency graph (text-only) from `dependsOn`/`installsAfter`.

**Independent Test**: Run `deacon features info dependencies <ref>` and validate boxed Mermaid `graph TD` output; JSON mode yields `{}` + exit 1.

### Tests (write first)
- [ ] T019 [P] [US3] CLI smoke test: dependency graph (text-only) in crates/deacon/tests/integration_features_info_dependencies.rs

### Implementation
- [ ] T020 [US3] Implement Mermaid graph builder and boxed section "Dependency Tree (Render with https://mermaid.live/)" in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs
- [ ] T021 [US3] Enforce JSON mode behavior for dependencies: `{}` + exit 1 in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs

**Checkpoint**: US3 independently demonstrable (text-only).

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 â€” Combined verbose view (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Aggregate Manifest/Canonical ID, Published Tags, and Dependency Graph (text); in JSON emit only `{ manifest, canonicalId, publishedTags }` with partial-failure policy.

**Independent Test**: Run `deacon features info verbose <ref>`; verify text has all three boxed sections; JSON omits graph and returns `errors` map + exit 1 on any sub-mode failure.

### Tests (write first)
- [ ] T022 [P] [US4] CLI smoke tests: verbose text + JSON partial-failure scenarios in crates/deacon/tests/integration_features_info_verbose.rs

### Implementation
- [ ] T023 [US4] Implement verbose aggregator with partial-failure policy and exit 1 on any error in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs

**Checkpoint**: US4 independently demonstrable.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T024 [P] Add tracing spans and fields: `feature.info.manifest|tags|dependencies|verbose` in crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs
- [ ] T025 [P] Update validation steps/examples in specs/004-close-features-info-gap/quickstart.md
- [ ] T026 Ensure JSON output purity (stdout-only) coverage for features info in crates/deacon/tests/json_output_purity.rs

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies
- Setup (Phase 1): None
- Foundational (Phase 2): Blocks all user stories
- US1 (P1): Depends on Phase 2; independent of other stories
- US2 (P1): Depends on Phase 2; independent of other stories
- US3 (P2): Depends on Phase 2; independent of US1/US2
- US4 (P2): Depends on US1, US2, and US3 (text aggregation includes graph)
- Polish: After targeted stories are complete

### User Story Dependency Graph (Mermaid)

```mermaid
graph TD
  F2[Foundational] --> US1[US1: Manifest & CanonicalId]
  F2 --> US2[US2: Tags]
  F2 --> US3[US3: Dependencies]
  US1 --> US4[US4: Verbose]
  US2 --> US4
  US3 --> US4
```

### Parallel Opportunities
- Within Phase 2: T002, T003, T007, T008, T009 can run in parallel; T004 follows T002/T003; T005â€“T006 can proceed in parallel on `oci.rs` if coordinated
- After Phase 2: US1 and US2 can proceed in parallel; US3 can also proceed in parallel; US4 waits for US1â€“US3
- Within each story: tests [P] can run in parallel; model/helpers [P] parallelize with CLI test scaffolding

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Phase 2 tasks T002â€“T006, T008
2. Implement US1 (T010â€“T015)
3. Validate via quickstart and smoke tests

### Incremental Delivery
1. Add US2 (T016â€“T018) â†’ validate independently
2. Add US3 (T019â€“T021) â†’ validate independently
3. Add US4 (T022â€“T023) â†’ validate independently
4. Polish (T024â€“T026)

- Total tasks: 26
- Task counts by user story:
  - US1: 6 (T010â€“T015)
  - US2: 3 (T016â€“T018)
  - US3: 3 (T019â€“T021)

  - Polish: 3 (T024â€“T026)
- Parallel opportunities: Highlighted in sections above (tests and independent modules)
- Independent test criteria:
  - US1: CLI produces boxed Manifest/Canonical sections (text) and `{ manifest, canonicalId }` JSON; invalid ref â‡’ `{}` + exit 1
  - US2: CLI prints boxed Published Tags (text) and `{ publishedTags: [...] }` JSON; empty/inaccessible â‡’ `{}` + exit 1
  - US3: CLI prints boxed Mermaid graph (text); JSON mode â‡’ `{}` + exit 1
  - US4: CLI prints all three boxed sections (text); JSON returns union of `{ manifest, canonicalId, publishedTags }` with `errors` on partial failure and exit 1
- Suggested MVP: User Story 1 (US1)
- Format validation: All tasks use required checklist format `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path`
