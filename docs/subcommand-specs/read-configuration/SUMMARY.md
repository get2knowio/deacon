# Read-Configuration: Implementation Gap Analysis Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive analysis of the `read-configuration` subcommand implementation has been completed and documented in:
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)** - Full detailed analysis
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)** - Quick status and priorities  
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)** - Progress tracking checklist

## Key Findings

**Overall Compliance: ~25%** - The implementation provides basic configuration reading but lacks most specification-required functionality.

### Critical Missing Features

1. **Container Integration (0% complete)**
   - ❌ No `--container-id` or `--id-label` flags
   - ❌ Cannot read metadata from running containers
   - ❌ No container environment variable substitution
   - ❌ No Docker integration

2. **Feature Resolution (0% complete)**
   - ❌ No `--include-features-configuration` flag
   - ❌ Cannot output feature information
   - ❌ No `--additional-features` support
   - ❌ Feature-derived metadata not included in merges

3. **Output Structure (0% spec-compliant)**
   - ❌ Missing `workspace` field
   - ❌ Missing `featuresConfiguration` field  
   - ⚠️ Wrong output structure (mutually exclusive fields instead of additive)

4. **Merge Algorithm (Incorrect semantics)**
   - ⚠️ Currently merges base + override configs
   - ❌ Spec requires base + image metadata
   - ❌ Metadata from container or features not included

5. **Input Validation (Missing)**
   - ❌ No "at least one selector" requirement enforcement
   - ❌ No `--id-label` format validation

### What Works Today

- ✅ Basic configuration file reading
- ✅ Override file merging (but wrong semantics)
- ✅ Host environment variable substitution
- ✅ JSONC parsing with comments
- ✅ Secrets loading from files
- ✅ Error reporting for missing configs

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (5-7 days)
1. Add container selection flags and Docker integration
2. Implement feature resolution and output
3. Fix output structure to match spec
4. Correct merge algorithm to use image metadata
5. Add required input validation

### Phase 2: Completeness (2-3 days)
6. Add Docker tooling configuration flags
7. Implement workspace config output
8. Add additional features support
9. Expand test coverage

### Phase 3: Polish (1-2 days)
10. Add terminal dimension flags
11. Cross-platform testing
12. Documentation and examples

## Breaking Changes Required

The following changes will break existing behavior:

1. **Output structure** - Must wrap config in object with `configuration`, `workspace`, etc. fields
2. **Merge semantics** - Change from "base + override" to "base + metadata"
3. **Validation** - Enforce required selector argument

**Recommendation:** Implement all breaking changes in a single release with migration guide.

## Comparison with Build Subcommand

Like the `build` subcommand analysis, `read-configuration` shows:
- ✅ Basic functionality working
- ❌ Advanced features missing
- ⚠️ Output format non-compliant
- ❌ Critical flags not implemented

Both subcommands need significant work to achieve spec compliance (~25% complete each).

## Next Actions

1. ✅ Review gap analysis documents
2. ⬜ Create GitHub issues for critical items
3. ⬜ Prioritize implementation roadmap
4. ⬜ Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. ⬜ Update tests to match spec
