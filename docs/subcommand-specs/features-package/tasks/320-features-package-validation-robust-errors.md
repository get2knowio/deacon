- [ ] Infrastructure/Cross-Cutting Concern
- [x] Error Handling
- [ ] Testing & Validation

## Parent Issue

- [ ] Error when collection is empty: "No features found in src/."
- [ ] Add tests asserting exact messages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improved errors implemented and covered by tests.
- [ ] CI green.

## Dependencies
