# [features-test] Autogenerated test.sh execution and results aggregation

<!-- Labels: subcommand:features-test, type:enhancement, priority:high -->
Tracks: #345, blocked by: #351

## Issue Type
- [x] Core Logic Implementation
- [x] Testing & Validation

## Description
Execute per-feature autogenerated tests using `test/<feature>/test.sh` and aggregate results as per DATA-STRUCTURES.md.

## Specification Reference
- SPEC.md ยง5 Core Execution Logic; ยง10 Output Specifications
- DATA-STRUCTURES.md TestResult schema
- DIAGRAMS.md Autogenerated Test sequence
- GAP.md ยง2.2 Test Modality Support

### Expected Behavior
- For each selected feature, run `test.sh` inside the temp workspace container; inject `dev-container-features-test-lib`.
- Collect `{ testName, result }` entries for each feature.
- Exit 0 only if all results are `true`.

## Implementation Requirements
- Use infrastructure from #351 to prepare workspace and run scripts.
- Capture exit codes and map to boolean results.
- Append to results array and print text summary.

## Testing Requirements
- Unit: result mapping
- Integration: sample feature with passing and failing test.sh

## Acceptance Criteria
- Correct aggregation; exit codes honored; CI green.
