## Summary
Add missing rustdoc and design notes to clarify behavior: why variable substitution is skipped, graph edge direction, merge semantics, and a note on registry authentication expectations. Add/update an example demonstrating the command.

## Details

Issue Type
- Other: Documentation

Parent Issue
Tracks: #298 (tracking issue)

Description
- Add rustdoc and design notes clarifying graph direction, variable substitution skipping, merge semantics, and registry auth expectations.
- Add example under `examples/feature-management/plan/` and update `examples/README.md`.

Specification Reference

From GAP.md Section: 3, 9, 11, 17 — Missing documentation and examples

Expected Behavior
- `build_graph_representation` has rustdoc explaining direction and union of relations
- Comment in code: variable substitution intentionally skipped for planning
- Docs mention registry auth is handled by OCI client; note limitations
- Example added under `examples/feature-management/plan/` with README

Implementation Requirements

1. Code Changes Required

Files to Modify
- `crates/deacon/src/commands/features.rs` — add rustdoc and comments
- `examples/feature-management/plan/` — add simple example (config + output sample)
- `examples/README.md` — index entry

Testing Requirements
- `cargo test --doc` passes

Acceptance Criteria
- Docs and examples present and accurate
