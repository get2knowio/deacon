//! Unit tests for features package functionality
//!
//! These tests focus on individual functions and error conditions
//! that are difficult to test in integration scenarios.

// Note: Unit tests for features package functions are now located in
// the features.rs file itself within the unit_features_package module.
// This file is kept for future tests that may need separate test modules.
