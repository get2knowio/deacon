## Examples Moved

The comprehensive examples have moved to `examples/README.md` (with categorized subdirectories in `examples/`).

Why the change:
- Keeps repository root slimmer.
- Allows each example category to evolve independently.

Next steps:
See `examples/README.md` for the up-to-date commands, including new with-options feature packaging & dry-run publish examples.
